Given a jsonp file that gives you a list of stories, headlines, summaries and photos, create a static webpage that does the following:

1. Performs a client side request to fetch the contents of this JSONP file.

2. Lay out the stories in a simple list with the information you think should display for each article. Extra points for making a beautiful  presentation of the list.

3. Make sure the page is responsive, with designs accommodating a 960+ web breakpoint, a 768 pixel tablet breakpoint, and a 320 pixel mobile breakpoint.

4.  Create the ability to toggle between English and a fake Martian language that follows these rules:
	- every word three characters or less is left alone
	- every word more than three characters is replaced with boinga.
	- maintain the same capitalization and punctuation in the English and Martian Versions.
